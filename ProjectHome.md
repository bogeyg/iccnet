ICCNET is a social prayer network of believers in Christ. It is not unlike sites such as Facebook, MySpace or Twitter. The main difference is in a prayer system integrated into the framework of the social engineering site. This project on Google Code is for the open source plugins created by ICCNET for the open source Elgg social networking engine (http://www.elgg.org).
